 You can open a private server with your mobile device using this app.

 All servers prepared below are not secured.
 When used on an untrusted network, someone working in the shadows can intercept and read or tamper with communication data.

 It's like a joke, but it's an important story, so please remember it :)

 If the network is not available at all, the mobile hotspot can be used as a network to communicate with the devices connected to the hotspot.
