 You can get the basic form of PPT operated by engine at https://github.com/is2you2/engineWorksPPT.git. As long as EnginePPT.tscn is operated as the main scene, it is okay to start with a new project or not to run it from a web page.
 If the PPT works on the web, it needs to be reviewed if it contains 3D elements that can be restricted on the web.

 Your phone and computer must be on the same network.
