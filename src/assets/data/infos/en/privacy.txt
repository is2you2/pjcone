 Project: Cone collects the following user information, but does not manage it.

1. When using the main server, the ID in email format and the unique ID of the device are collected and used as member information.
2. Instead of being a perfect anonymity system, there is no membership withdrawal function using the app.

 Project: Cone does not collect communications with the private servers configured by the user or interact with how the user operates the server.

 All kinds of policies/incidents/events that may occur on the private server are the responsibility of the private server manager, and if necessary, the server user must be notified in a suitable way.

 When using a private server through this app, we recommend that you use a server from a trusted group. Project:Cone does not take any responsibility for what happens on the private server.

 * Account-related issues in the current version
 Since the device-specific ID is being used as member information, there is a problem that you cannot enter the existing account if the device you are using is changed.
