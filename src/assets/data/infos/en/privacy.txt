 Project: Cone collects the following user information, but does not specifically manage it.

1. When using a group server, an ID in email format and a device-specific ID are collected and used as member information.
2. When using the membership function in community tools and services, the account information of the group server is used together.
3. Instead of being a perfect anonymity system, there is no membership withdrawal function using the app.

 Project: Cone does not collect communication with the private server configured by the user or intervene in the operation method.
 
 All kinds of policies/incidents/events that may occur on the private server are the responsibility of the private server manager and must be notified in a way suitable for server users.
 
 When using a private server through this app, you must use a server of a trusted group.

 * Account-related issues in the current version
 Since the device-specific ID is being used as member information, there is a problem that you cannot enter the existing account if the device you are using is changed.
